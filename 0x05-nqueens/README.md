# N-Queens Problem

The N-Queens problem is a classic puzzle that involves placing N chess queens on an N×N chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. In other words, no two queens should share the same row, column, or diagonal.

## Problem Description

The N-Queens problem can be stated as follows:

Given an integer N, find all possible solutions to the N-Queens problem. Each solution represents a way to place N queens on an N×N chessboard without any of them threatening each other.

## Approach

There are various algorithms to solve the N-Queens problem, such as the Backtracking algorithm, which systematically explores all possible configurations and prunes those that violate the rules. The N-Queens problem is a classic example of a combinatorial problem that can be efficiently solved using backtracking.

## Implementation

The implementation of the N-Queens problem involves finding a solution that satisfies the constraints of the problem. This often involves using techniques like recursion and backtracking to explore possible configurations and ensure that queens are placed without conflicts.

### Example Pseudocode

Here's a simplified pseudocode representation of solving the N-Queens problem using backtracking:

function solveNQueens(board, row):
if row == N:
addSolution(board) // Store the current configuration as a solution
return

```for each column in the row:
    if isSafe(board, row, column):
        placeQueen(board, row, column)
        solveNQueens(board, row + 1)
        removeQueen(board, row, column)
```

function isSafe(board, row, column):
// Check if placing a queen at (row, column) is safe

function placeQueen(board, row, column):
// Place a queen at (row, column) on the board

function removeQueen(board, row, column):
// Remove a queen from (row, column) on the board


## Usage

To solve the N-Queens problem, you can implement the above approach in your preferred programming language. Here are the general steps you can follow:

1. Define a data structure to represent the chessboard.
2. Implement functions to check if placing a queen is safe, place a queen, and remove a queen.
3. Implement a recursive function to explore configurations and find solutions.
4. Store valid solutions for further analysis or display.
