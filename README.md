### Usage

To use the Pascal's Triangle code, follow these steps:

1. Open the `0x00-pascal-triangle/pascal-triangle.py` file.
2. Implement the functions for generating Pascal's Triangle or performing operations on it.
3. Open the `pascals-triangle/test.js` file.
4. Write test cases to validate the functionality of the Pascal's Triangle code.
5. Run the tests using a test runner or a test framework of your choice.

### Examples

Here's an example of how to generate and print Pascal's Triangle using the provided code:

```javascript
// Import the Pascal's Triangle module
const pascalsTriangle = require('./pascals-triangle');

// Generate Pascal's Triangle with 5 rows
const triangle = pascalsTriangle.generateTriangle(5);

// Print the generated triangle
console.log(triangle);
